excerpt: 'We use ​CARLA, an autonomous driving simulator, to collect ​6 hours​ of human driver reactions to obstacles under given commands (follow, go straight, turn left, turn right). We propose a ​Behavior-Cloning​ network with a ​modified loss function​ that emphasizes steering errors for higher accuracy. Results show that ​image augmentation​ is crucial for training, and a ​speed limit​ helps prevent unexpected stops.'

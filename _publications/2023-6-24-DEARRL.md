excerpt: 'We propose a method to construct a boundary that discriminates between safe and unsafe states. The boundary we construct is equivalent to distinguishing dead-end states, indicating the maximum extent to which safe exploration is guaranteed, and thus has a minimum limitation on exploration.'

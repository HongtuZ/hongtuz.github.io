excerpt: 'We propose CERTAIN to tackle context ambiguity and OOD issues in one-shot adaptation for COMRL by leveraging uncertainty-aware task representation learning and context collection. Build upon heteroscedastic-like uncertainty estimation, our method can identify unreliable contexts and then lead to more robust policies.'

excerpt: 'We propose a ​Driving Behaviour-Oriented (DBO) trajectory planner​ and ​Hierarchical AHP (HAHP) decision-maker​ for intelligent vehicles. Unlike purely minimizing distance/time, our approach ensures ​actuator constraints, comfort, and strict traffic rule compliance​ for structured road driving.'

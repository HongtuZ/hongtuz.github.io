excerpt: 'We propose an enhanced heuristic-based vine expansion method, termed Batch Informed Vines (BIV*). BIV* utilizes path information from the current search tree as heuristics to prioritize the exploration of narrow passages leading to lower solution cost. Additionally, we propose a batch vine expansion strategy, which includes exploration of “Closer to Unexplored Obstacle” (CTUO) nodes and batch expansion.'

excerpt: 'We propose FCN-A*, a real-time multiple path planning method combining semantic segmentation with the traditional graph-based search. A fully convolutional neural network (FCN) was first designed to learn the optimal path area generated by an A* based path planning method in various real and simulated environments. By injecting noises into localization information, the generalization ability of the neural network is greatly enhanced facing inaccurate localization results. Then, multiple possible path areas inferred by the FCN are adopted as constraints for the following A* based path planning.'

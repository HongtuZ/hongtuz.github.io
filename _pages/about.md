Hi there! I’m currently a PhD student at the School of Computer Science and Technology, [Tongji University](https://cs.tongji.edu.cn/) in Shanghai, China.
I’ve been fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Junqiao Zhao](http://cs1.tongji.edu.cn/~junqiao/) since my master’s studies began in 2018 — and the journey continues!

Before that, I earned my bachelor’s degree from [Jiangnan University](http://www.jiangnan.edu.cn/), where I first discovered my passion for technology and intelligent systems.

My research interests lie in autonomous driving and robotics, especially in decision-making, planning, and reinforcement learning. I’m always excited to explore new ideas and collaborate with others in these fields.

Feel free to reach out if you’re curious about my work or just want to chat about anything related — I’d be happy to connect!
